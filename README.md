# 🚗📊 Accident Analysis and Visualization

🔍📈 This repository presents an in-depth analysis and visualization of accident data, focusing on various factors such as driver demographics, road conditions, weather conditions, collision types, and more. The dataset used for analysis is available as "cleaned.csv".

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🐼 Pandas
- 📊 Matplotlib
- 📈 Seaborn
- 🗺️ Geopandas

## 📜 Usage

1. 📥 Clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/Debolina10Chatterjee/PRODIGY_DS_05.git
```

2. 🚀 Open and run the "accident_analysis.ipynb" notebook in Colab Notebook to execute the Python code cells and visualize the data analysis.

3. 🔍 Explore the insights and visualizations generated to gain a better understanding of accident patterns and contributing factors.

## 📊 Data Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook file "accident_analysis.ipynb" contains Python code for data analysis and visualization.

- 🚘 **Importing and Exploring Data**: The dataset is imported using Pandas, and basic information like data types and summary statistics are explored.
- 👩‍✈️ **Accident Count by Sex of Driver**: Visualizes the count of accidents based on the sex of the driver using a bar plot.
- 🛣️ **Road and Weather Conditions Analysis**: Analyzes the distribution of accidents based on road and weather conditions using bar plots.
- ☀️ **Light Conditions Analysis**: Examines the distribution of accidents based on light conditions using a bar plot.
- 📊 **Age Distribution of Drivers**: Visualizes the age distribution of drivers involved in accidents using a histogram.
- 💥 **Types of Collision Analysis**: Analyzes the distribution of different types of collisions using a histogram.
- 🔴 **Accident Severity by Educational Level and Driving Experience**: Investigates the relationship between accident severity and educational level, as well as driving experience, using stacked bar charts and heatmaps.
- 🌐 **Weather Conditions vs. Road Surface Types Heatmap**: Creates a heatmap to visualize the relationship between weather conditions and road surface types.
- 🌀 **Junction Types vs. Collision Types Radar Chart**: Presents a radar chart to analyze the relationship between junction types and collision types.
- 🍰 **Distribution of Accidents by Road Surface Type and Weather**: Visualizes the distribution of accidents by road surface type and weather using pie charts.
- 🗺️ **Geospatial Plot of Accident Hotspots**: Utilizes Geopandas to create a geospatial plot showing accident hotspots.
- 🔄 **Pairplot and Correlation Heatmap**: Generates a pairplot and correlation heatmap to explore relationships between different variables.

## 📊 Visualization

The analysis is accompanied by various visualizations including bar plots, histograms, radar charts, pie charts, geospatial plots, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps to provide insights into accident patterns and relationships between different factors.
